# Capstone_Project
Making AI Less Thirsty : This project uses machine learning to predict data-center water use (WUE) and CO₂ emissions, then recommends actions to reduce them. It identifies when and why impact rises and suggests workload or cooling adjustments, turning predictions into practical sustainability guidance.
